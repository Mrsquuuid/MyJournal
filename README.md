   1. The “best moments this week” module in the home page is empty once you login as you haven’t stored an image.
   2. To show images in the “best moments” module, you can either use a camera to take an image or select one from the mobile album.
   3. Make sure the camera of the emulator/mobile is available to be used. (For Nox, use the camera app in Nox to test the camera before using our app)
   4. Make sure there is at least one image in your emulator’s/mobile’s album. (For Nox, dragging the image from computer to the emulator can add a new image in the emulator album; or save the image in a directory used for local sharing between computer and emulator called Nox_share)
